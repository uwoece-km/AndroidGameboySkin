I think we need this:

A custom view that is just a blank canvas
The screen layout as:

Linear layout (vertical) OF
BlankCanvas - My implemented class
GridLayout - This one needs to be organized such that the buttons have the right sizes, and gravity bound DOWN.  I think by doing that, the previous blank canvas will take up the whole remaining space.
